# fertilizer_prediction
This project implements a machine learning-based fertilizer recommendation system. It predicts  based on environmental and soil parameters such as temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, crop type, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels. The system not only predicts the fertilizer but also provides information about its usage and benefits.
